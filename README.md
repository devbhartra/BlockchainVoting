# Blockchain Voting
### For Microsoft Codefundo++

## The Idea: 
  An alternative voting platform to increase overall voter participation, reduce election costs and make the entire process financially efficient while upholding the highest security, verifiability and integrity standards by using Azure Blockchain to maintain this integrity.

The plan is to implement a multi-tiered blockchain architecture that satisﬁes the needs of local governments to regulate their voting cycles, but adds the decentralized eﬃciencies of a blockchain. The model will be analyzed in 2 aspects – Security and Performance. The chief aim of the proposed model is to maximize the performance of the voting network without any compromise in the security, and allow secure remote access as well. 

The main goal of our model is to create such a voting system which is similar to real-world voting but is decentralized and independent. By designing its network as a multi-layer blockchain and using a consensus algorithm, the model accomplishes this task and allows the votes to be linked with additional useful information, such as time of casting, eligibility to vote, etc.

The multi-layer model is preferred over a general single layered one since multiple smaller chains can be managed more efficiently and reduce the chance of any errors, and their individual results can be synced on the higher layer at given time intervals.  

The two layers will be termed as primary and secondary. Multiple secondary layer chains will be deployed on a zonal/city level and their individual records of the casted votes will be reflected on the higher level primary chain, hence enabling flexibility, scalability and extensibility to the system, while upholing the chief pillars of blockchain, namely: Decentralization, Transparency and Immutability.

## The issues we hope to eliminate: 

1. Enable people to vote from outside their registered constituency since the entire model enables remote voting.
2. Completely eliminate the possiblility of EVM security breaches without jeopardizing the integrity or availability of the                            database storing the votes.
3. The model will keep a track of the tallies of the votes in real time. And by doing so, the final results declaration can be expedited.
